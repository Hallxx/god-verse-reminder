# God Reminder

Never forget that God always love you [Video demo]()

#### Description:
I am christian, and sometimes i need to hear God's voice, because of i feel sad, angry, stressed, anxious, frustrated, and so on.

That is why i created this Chrome Extension. With the help of this extension, I am reminded with some verses of the bible that God is always talking to me and he has never left me.

By default every verse will appear each 30 minutes, but you can modify it if you want to.

**Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for Harvard's [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).
