# God Verse Reminder

Never forget that God always loves you [Video demo](https://youtu.be/F655f1kfDaQ)

## Description

### Inspiration and Personal Motivation

I am a Christian, and like many people, there are moments in my life when I feel overwhelmed by emotions. Sometimes I feel sad, angry, stressed, anxious, frustrated, or simply tired. In those moments, I need to hear God's voice and be reminded of His presence, His promises, and His love. I believe that God speaks to us through His Word, and that the Bible is a constant source of comfort, guidance, and strength.

That personal need is what inspired me to create God Verse Reminder, a simple but meaningful Chrome Extension designed to remind users that God is always with them. This extension periodically displays Bible verses as notifications on your screen, helping you pause for a moment, reflect, and reconnect with God throughout your day.

### The Problem This Extension Solves

In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in daily responsibilities, work deadlines, academic pressures, and personal challenges. We often find ourselves so busy that we forget to take a moment to breathe, reflect, and connect with our faith. Even as believers, we can go hours or even entire days without reading Scripture or remembering God's promises.

This is especially true when we're facing difficult times. During moments of stress, anxiety, or sadness, we need spiritual encouragement the most, yet those are often the times when we neglect to seek it. We might tell ourselves we'll read the Bible later, or we simply forget in the midst of everything else demanding our attention.

God Verse Reminder was created to bridge this gap. It serves as a gentle, consistent reminder that God is present in every moment of our lives, not just when we remember to seek Him. The extension brings Scripture directly to you, wherever you are working, studying, or browsing, eliminating the barrier of having to remember to open your Bible or Bible app.

### Why This Matters to Me

This project is deeply personal. It represents not just what I've learned in CS50 about programming and software development, but also what matters most to me in life: my faith. Creating this extension allowed me to combine my growing technical skills with my desire to create something that could genuinely help people in their spiritual journey.

Every time I see one of these notifications appear on my own screen, I'm reminded of why I created this extension. It's not just about displaying text; it's about creating moments of connection with God throughout the day. If this extension can help even one other person feel more connected to God, more encouraged in their faith, or more aware of His presence, then the hours spent developing it will have been worthwhile.

**Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for Harvard's [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

## How the Extension Works

Once installed, God Verse Reminder will automatically display a Bible verse as a notification every 30 minutes by default. Each verse is selected randomly from a predefined list of Bible passages, ensuring variety and preventing repetition.

You can customize the time interval according to your personal preference. If you want reminders more frequently or less often, you can easily change the interval using the extension's popup menu. This flexibility allows you to adapt the extension to your daily routine and spiritual needs.

The notifications appear as banners on the screen (depending on system settings), and each one contains:

- A short Bible verse
- The corresponding biblical reference
- A clear and simple presentation for easy reading
