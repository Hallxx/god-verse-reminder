# God Verse Reminder

Never forget that God always love you [Video demo]()

#### Description:
I am a Christian, and like many people, there are moments in my life when I feel overwhelmed by emotions. Sometimes I feel sad, angry, stressed, anxious, frustrated, or simply tired. In those moments, I need to hear God’s voice and be reminded of His presence, His promises, and His love. I believe that God speaks to us through His Word, and that the Bible is a constant source of comfort, guidance, and strength.

That personal need is what inspired me to create God Verse Reminder, a simple but meaningful Chrome Extension designed to remind users that God is always with them. This extension periodically displays Bible verses as notifications on your screen, helping you pause for a moment, reflect, and reconnect with God throughout your day.

In the middle of daily routines, responsibilities, studies, work, or moments of stress, it is easy to forget to stop and listen. God Verse Reminder acts as a gentle reminder that God has not left us, that He is still speaking, and that His Word is always available to encourage us. Each notification is meant to be a small moment of peace, reflection, and spiritual encouragement.

By default every verse will appear each 30 minutes, but you can modify it if you want to.

**Note:** This extension was originally submitted as my final project for Harvard's [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

#### How the Extension Works

Once installed, God Verse Reminder will automatically display a Bible verse as a notification every 30 minutes by default. Each verse is selected randomly from a predefined list of Bible passages, ensuring variety and preventing repetition.

You can customize the time interval according to your personal preference. If you want reminders more frequently or less often, you can easily change the interval using the extension’s popup menu. This flexibility allows you to adapt the extension to your daily routine and spiritual needs.

The notifications appear as banners on the screen (depending on system settings), and each one contains:

- A short Bible verse

- The corresponding biblical reference

- A clear and simple presentation for easy reading
